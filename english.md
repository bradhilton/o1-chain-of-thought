The following passage is the draft of an excerpt from a contemporary book about maintaining health.

(1) Curiously, there is good evidence that for many people, an increase in body weight might not require an increase in calorie consumption at all.
(2) In most scientific studies it is difficult to determine how much people are eating, because appetite regulation is a field of staggering complexity.
(3) (Have you ever had to tell your doctor whether you drink beer or binge out on chips or ice cream?)
(4) But in certain controlled environments, where sneaking in an unreported chocolate bar is unlikely, interesting insights can be gained.
(5) U.S. prisons have long been fertile ground for nutrition research, with a number of prisoner-feeding experiments being conducted over the years.
(6) Overfeeding studies in the twentieth century by the researcher Erich Sims showed that subjects gain different amounts of weight despite eating identical amounts of food, indicating that the "calories-expended" side of the equation varies considerably between individuals, independent of exercise or other physical activity.
(7) It also showed different amounts of resistance to weight gain, as subjects' metabolic rates seemed to increase on overeating, their bodies trying hard not to lay down too much of their excessive food intake as fat.
(8) The extent to which this happened varied significantly among individuals, despite the similarity of their diet and environment.
(9) These results are only curious if we assume that everyone reacts to food in exactly the same way.
(10) Experience tells us, however, that it is a bit more complicated than that.
(11) Everybody processes their food differently.
(12) You might burn calories faster.
(13) Another person stores more calories.
(14) What is eaten also matters since reaction varies based on nutritional intake.
(15) That applies even when people appear in terms of their age, height, and weight dimensions are equivalent.
(16) A diverse population would have a number of evolutionary advantages, with some individuals prioritizing the effective storage of fat in order to survive and others burning most of their energy exploring.
(17) It would also make sense for us to be able to switch between those two states when we needed to.
(18) But how is it that the amount of weight gained from identical food intake can vary among individuals?
(19) Even though hormones regulate our feeding, we only store calories when we eat more than we burn, right?
(20) When we consider the "calories out" side of the equation, we almost always look at exercise as the most important factor, largely because it is the one area that we can easily change.
(21) But basal metabolism is by far the largest chunk of the energy we burn.
(22) We generally expend around half our calories staying alive, and another 10 percent staying at the right temperature.
(23) Around 30 percent goes towards physical activity, and the remaining 10 percent on digesting food.

In sentence 2 (reproduced below), which of the following versions of the bolded text best explains the writer's position expressed in the main clause of the sentence?

In most scientific studies it is difficult to determine how much people are eating, because appetite regulation is a field of staggering complexity.
A) (as it is now)
B) researchers seldom ask the right questions
C) different foods have varying impacts on the digestive system
D) people generally submit their own data and this isn't seen as reliable
E) psychological factors determine why certain foods are more popular than others

### Chain of Thought

This is a question about choosing the explanation in bold that best fits the writer's position expressed in the main clause.

First, let's understand what the main clause says.

Original sentence:

(2) In most scientific studies it is difficult to determine how much people are eating, because appetite regulation is a field of staggering complexity.

We need to choose the best bolded text that explains why "it is difficult to determine how much people are eating" in scientific studies.

Option A: as it is now (i.e., leave it as is: "because appetite regulation is a field of staggering complexity.")
Option B: researchers seldom ask the right questions
Option C: different foods have varying impacts on the digestive system
Option D: people generally submit their own data and this isn't seen as reliable
Option E: psychological factors determine why certain foods are more popular than others

Our task is to pick the best option that explains why it's difficult to determine how much people are eating in scientific studies.

Let's analyze each option.

Option A: "because appetite regulation is a field of staggering complexity."

Is that a good explanation? Hmm.

Option B: "because researchers seldom ask the right questions."

Does this make sense with the main clause?

Main clause: "In most scientific studies it is difficult to determine how much people are eating, because researchers seldom ask the right questions."

Is the writer saying that? Does the context in the passage suggest that?

Option C: "because different foods have varying impacts on the digestive system."

Does that explain why it's difficult to determine how much people are eating?

Hmmâ€¦ Probably not directly.

Option D: "because people generally submit their own data and this isn't seen as reliable."

Is that relevant? Does that explain why it's difficult to determine how much people are eating in scientific studies?

Yes, that seems plausible: if people generally submit their own data (e.g., self-reporting their consumption), and this isn't reliable, it's difficult to determine how much people are eating.

Option E: "because psychological factors determine why certain foods are more popular than others."

Is that explaining why it's difficult to determine how much people are eating?

Probably not directly.

Given that the following sentence is:

(3) (Have you ever had to tell your doctor whether you drink beer or binge out on chips or ice cream?)

This suggests that people have to self-report, and perhaps they may not be accurate.

Therefore, Option D seems to fit.

Also, in the previous paragraph, the writer seems to point out that in certain controlled environments (like prisons) where sneaking in unreported chocolate bars is unlikely, interesting insights can be gained.

This implies that in studies outside controlled environments, people might be consuming unreported calories, or not reporting accurately.

Therefore, Option D seems to be the best.

So, the answer is Option D.

### Answer

To determine the best replacement for the bolded text, we need to find the option that best explains why it is difficult to determine how much people are eating in most scientific studies.

Option D states: "people generally submit their own data and this isn't seen as reliable." This directly addresses the challenge researchers face: reliance on self-reported data, which can be inaccurate due to forgetfulness, underreporting, or intentional misreporting. This unreliability makes it difficult to determine actual food intake.

This explanation aligns with the context provided in the subsequent sentence, which mentions the difficulty people might have in accurately reporting their consumption of items like beer, chips, or ice cream to their doctor.

Answer: D
