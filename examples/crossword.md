### Chain of Thought

Here is the text content of the document, reproduced word for word:

We are asked to solve this crossword puzzle.

Let's first make sense of the grid:

- It's a 6x6 grid, numbered from 1 to 11 in the following positions:

+---+---+---+---+---+---+
| 1 | 7 | 8 | 9 |10 |11 |
+---+---+---+---+---+---+
| 2 |   |   |   |   |   |
+---+---+---+---+---+---+
| 3 |   |   |   |   |   |
+---+---+---+---+---+---+
| 4 |   |   |   |   |   |
+---+---+---+---+---+---+
| 5 |   |   |   |   |   |
+---+---+---+---+---+---+
| 6 |   |   |   |   |   |
+---+---+---+---+---+---+

So across entries are numbered as 1 to 6, and down entries from 1 to 11.

But actually, the clues are:

Across:

1. Evade
2. One to close envelopes
3. Mother ______
4. Initiated people
5. Native American tent
6. Mistakes

Down:

1. ______ car (Station wagon)
7. Automatic planting machine
8. Profession
9. Syrian and Turkish pepper variety
10. Annoy
11. Deletes

First, let's try to number the squares properly, I think in such grids, the numbers at the starting squares of entries.

But we need to figure out where words start.

Given the numbering from 1 to 11 in the grid, and given that number 1 is the first across clue.

Usually, across and down clues correspond to numbers in the grid, and the number is placed in the square where we start the first letter.

Given that, maybe let's construct a grid that makes sense.

Usually in crossword numbering, the numbers are assigned to the first letter in the across and down entries, numbered sequentially.

Given that, the grid likely is (It would have been more helpful if we had a clearer picture, but we'll make do.)

Given the grid:

[1] [7] [8] [9][10][11]    <-- first row  
[2]                            <-- first letter of Across 2 in the first square of row 2  
[3]                            <-- first letter of Across 3 in the first square of row 3  
[4]                            <-- first letter of Across 4 in the first square of row 4  
[5]                            <-- Across 5  
[6]                            <-- Across 6  

Then for the down entries, the numbers in the first row correspond to down entries.

Down
1. ______ car (station wagon) [Clue is '____ car (station wagon)']

Number 1 is in the upper left corner.

So Down 1 starts at square 1 and goes down vertically.

Similarly, Down 7 starts at square 7 (which is in the first row, second column), and goes down.

Similarly for rest of numbers.

So let's map out the numbers.

The grid is:

[1] [7] [8] [9][10][11]  
[2]  
[3]  
[4]  
[5]  
[6]  

So Across 1 starts at square 1 and goes across.

Similarly in row 2, the square is numbered 2 in the first square, so Across 2.

But Down entries are in the first row.

Down 1 starts at square 1 and goes down.

Similarly Down 7 starts at square (1,2), that is, first row, second column.

OK, with that in mind, let's proceed to solve the crossword.

First, we need the entry lengths.

Across 1 starts at (1,1) and fills as many squares as needed.

Given the grid is 6 squares wide, and 6 squares high.

From the grid dimensions, across entries can be up to 6 letters long.

But more likely is that across entries start at square 1, and fill the row.

So, mapping the grid, and filling in the numbering:

Positions (row, col):

(1,1): numbered 1 (Across 1 starts here, Down 1 starts here)
(1,2): numbered 7 (Down 7 starts here)
(1,3): numbered 8 (Down 8 starts here)
(1,4): numbered 9 (Down 9 starts here)
(1,5): numbered 10 (Down 10 starts here)
(1,6): numbered 11 (Down 11 starts here)

(2,1): numbered 2 (Across 2 starts here, probably no down clue starting here)

(3,1): numbered 3 (Across 3 starts here)

(4,1): numbered 4 (Across 4 starts here)

(5,1): numbered 5 (Across 5 starts here)

(6,1): numbered 6 (Across 6 starts here)

So each across word starts at the first column of each row, and down words start at the first row in each column.

Now let's figure out how many letters the entries are.

Since the grid is 6 squares wide, and there are no black squares (assumed), each across entry can be up to 6 letters long.

Similarly, down entries can be up to 6 letters long.

So let's write down the words with their lengths.

First, list the words for Across words:

1. Evade (starts at (1,1) and goes across): length is 6 letters.

2. One to close envelopes (starts at (2,1)): length is 6 letters.

3. Mother ______ (starts at (3,1)): length 6 letters.

4. Initiated people (starts at (4,1)): length 6 letters.

5. Native American tent (starts at (5,1)): length 6 letters.

6. Mistakes (starts at (6,1)): length 6 letters.

Similarly for Down words.

Down clues:

1. ______ car (station wagon) (starts at (1,1)): down from (1,1). So length 6 letters.

7. Automatic planting machine (starts at (1,2)): down from (1,2). Length 6 letters.

8. Profession (starts at (1,3)): length 6 letters.

9. Syrian and Turkish pepper variety (starts at (1,4)): length 6 letters.

10. Annoy (starts at (1,5)): length 6 letters.

11. Deletes (starts at (1,6)): length 6 letters.

So all entries are 6 letters long.

OK, now let's start filling in what we can.

First, let's consider the across entries.

1 Across: Evade (6 letters)

Possible words for 'Evade' of 6 letters:

ESCAPE (6 letters)

AVOID (5 letters)

DODGE (5 letters)

ELUDE (5 letters)

Maybe 'ESCAPE' which is 6 letters.

But let's keep considering.

2 Across: One to close envelopes (6 letters)

Possible words: SEALER (6 letters)

ENVELOPE CLOSER (too long)

Maybe SEALER

3 Across: Mother ______ (6 letters)

Mother Nature (6 letters)

Yes, that's 6 letters.

Alternatively, Mother Goose (10 letters)

But 'Mother Nature' fits.

4 Across: Initiated people (6 letters)

Possible words: ADEPTS (6 letters)

Maybe 'ADEPTS' means initiated people.

Other possibilities?

We can think of 'INSIDE' (6 letters), but that does not make sense.

ADEPTS seems possible.

5 Across: Native American tent (6 letters)

This is TEPEES (6 letters)

or TIPI (but that's only 4 letters)

TEPEES works.

Alternatively, WIGWAM (6 letters)

Yes, WIGWAM is 6 letters.

6 Across: Mistakes (6 letters)

Possible words: ERRORS (6 letters)

That's an obvious possibility.

Now let's look at Down clues.

1 Down: _____ car (station wagon) (6 letters)

Possible words:

- ESTATE car (6 letters)

In British English, 'Estate car' is a term for station wagon.

Since 'station wagon' is called 'estate car' in the UK.

Therefore 'ESTATE' fits.

Also aligns with ESCAPE as Across 1.

If we have ESCAPE as 1 Across, starting at (1,1) across, and ESTATE going down from (1,1).

First letter is E, second letter is S (from both words.)

So let's write that:

ESCAPE
E S C A P E

VERTICAL from 1st letter E, down entries up to 6 letters, starting letters at (1,1), (1,2), etc.

So Down 1 is ESTATE

E
S
T
A
T
E

Crossing ESCAPE at E S C A P E

Second letter is S in both across and down.

Now 7 Down: Automatic planting machine (6 letters), starting at (1,2). First letter is S (from ESCAPE, second letter)

Possible words:

SOWER? (5 letters)

PLANTERS? (8 letters)

SEEDER? (6 letters)

Yes, SEEDER (6 letters)

So 7 Down is SEEDER.

So we have ESCAPE across (1,1)-(1,6), and SEEDER down from (1,2) to (6,2).

Now, at position (1,2), we have S from ESCAPE.

Vertical down from S is SEEDER.

Confirming S's.

Now 8 Down: Profession (6 letters), starting at (1,3), third letter of ESCAPE is C, so position (1,3) is C (from ESCAPE)

We need a 6-letter word meaning 'Profession', starting with C.

Possible words: CAREER (6 letters)

Yes, CAREER

So, we have ESCAPE as across:

E S C A P E

8 Down starting at position (1,3) is C from ESCAPE, so CAREER:

C
A
R
E
E
R

Now, 9 Down: Syrian and Turkish pepper variety (6 letters), starting at (1,4)

Fourth letter in ESCAPE is A, position (1,4) is A

So we have a 6-letter word, meaning 'Syrian and Turkish pepper variety', starting with A.

Possible words: ALEPPO (6 letters)

Aleppo pepper is a type of pepper from Syria and Turkey

So ALEPPO fits.

So 9 Down is ALEPPO, starting at (1,4), first letter A.

So position (1,4) is A (from ESCAPE), matching.

Now, 10 Down: Annoy (6 letters), starting at (1,5)

Position (1,5) is P from ESCAPE

Annoy, 6 letters, starting with P

Possible words: PEEVES (6 letters)

That seems plausible.

PESTER (6 letters)

PESTER starts with P, meaning 'annoy'

How about that?

So we have P in position (1,5) from ESCAPE, so P in both words.

So 10 Down is PESTER.

Now 11 Down: Deletes (6 letters), starting at (1,6)

Position (1,6) is E from ESCAPE

So we need a 6-letter word meaning 'Deletes', starting with E.

Possible words: ERASES (6 letters)

Yes, ERASES

So 11 Down is ERASES.

Now, let's check:

- ESCAPE across: E S C A P E

- Down words:

1D: E S T A T E

Matches at E S T A T E

7D: S E E D E R

Position (1,2): S (from ESCAPE), down: S E E D E R

8D: C A R E E R

Position (1,3): C (from ESCAPE), down: C A R E E R

9D: A L E P P O

Position (1,4): A (from ESCAPE), down: A L E P P O

10D: P E S T E R

Position (1,5): P (from ESCAPE), down: P E S T E R

11D: E R A S E S

Position (1,6): E (from ESCAPE), down: E R A S E S

Now, let's work on the rest of the across entries with the letters we get from the down words.

At position (2,1), Across 2 starts with the letter from 1D at position (2,1)

Position (2,1): From 1D, second letter is S (E S T A T E), so letter in (2,1) is S.

Across 2: One to close envelopes (6 letters): We previously thought SEALER

So starting at letter S.

Now let's see if it fits.

Letters:

Position (2,1): S (from ESTATE)
Position (2,2): From 7D: second letter E (from SEEDER)
Position (2,3): From 8D: second letter A (from CAREER)
Position (2,4): From 9D: second letter L (from ALEPPO)
Position (2,5): From 10D: second letter E (from PESTER)
Position (2,6): From 11D: second letter R (from ERASES)

So the letters in row 2 are:

Positions (2,1)-(2,6):

S E A L E R

Which spells SEALER.

Perfect! So Across 2 is SEALER, meaning 'One to close envelopes', fits both clue and interlocking letters.

Similarly for 3 Across.

Position (3,1): From 1D, third letter T (E S T A T E). So letter at (3,1) is T

Across 3: Mother ______ (6 letters)

Possible 'Mother Nature'.

But from letters:

Position (3,1): T (from ESTATE)

Positions (3,1)-(3,6):

Letters at positions (3,1)-(3,6):

(3,1): T (from ESTATE)
(3,2): From 7D third letter E (from SEEDER)
(3,3): From 8D third letter R (from CAREER)
(3,4): From 9D third letter E (from ALEPPO)
(3,5): From 10D third letter S (from PESTER)
(3,6): From 11D third letter A (from ERASES)

Letters: T E R E S A

So it spells TERESA

So 'Mother TERESA'

So 3 Across is 'Mother TERESA'

Which fits.

Now 4 Across:

Position (4,1): From 1D fourth letter A (E S T A T E), so letter at (4,1) is A

Across 4: Initiated people (6 letters)

Starting with A

Positions (4,1)-(4,6):

Letters:

(4,1): A (from ESTATE)
(4,2): From 7D fourth letter D (from SEEDER)
(4,3): From 8D fourth letter E (from CAREER)
(4,4): From 9D fourth letter P (from ALEPPO)
(4,5): From 10D fourth letter T (from PESTER)
(4,6): From 11D fourth letter S (from ERASES)

Letters: A D E P T S

Spells 'ADEPTS'

So 'Initiated people' is 'ADEPTS', as previously supposed.

Now 5 Across:

Position (5,1): From 1D fifth letter T (E S T A T E), so letter at (5,1) is T

Across 5: Native American tent (6 letters)

Starting with T

Possible words: TEPEES

Positions (5,1)-(5,6):

Letters:

(5,1): T (from ESTATE)
(5,2): From 7D fifth letter E (from SEEDER)
(5,3): From 8D fifth letter E (from CAREER)
(5,4): From 9D fifth letter P (from ALEPPO)
(5,5): From 10D fifth letter E (from PESTER)
(5,6): From 11D fifth letter E (from ERASES)

Letters: T E E P E E

Spells TEEPEE (alternate spelling of TEPEE)

Yes, TEEPEE is a Native American tent.

So Across 5 is TEEPEE

Finally, Across 6:

Position (6,1): From 1D sixth letter E (from ESTATE), so letter at (6,1) is E

Across 6: Mistakes (6 letters)

Possible words: ERRORS

Positions (6,1)-(6,6):

Letters:

(6,1): E (from ESTATE)
(6,2): From 7D sixth letter R (from SEEDER)
(6,3): From 8D sixth letter R (from CAREER)
(6,4): From 9D sixth letter O (from ALEPPO)
(6,5): From 10D sixth letter R (from PESTER)
(6,6): From 11D sixth letter S (from ERASES)

Letters: E R R O R S

Spells ERRORS, meaning 'Mistakes', which fits.

So we've successfully filled the entire crossword.

Let me write out the entire grid with the filled words:

Grid, where rows are numbered 1 to 6 from top to bottom, columns are numbered 1 to 6 from left to right.

Positions are (row,column)

Row 1 (positions (1,1)-(1,6)):

E S C A P E

Row 2:

S E A L E R

Row3:

T E R E S A

Row4:

A D E P T S

Row5:

T E E P E E

Row6:

E R R O R S

Columns, Down entries:

Column 1 (positions (1,1)-(6,1)):

E S T A T E

Column2:

S E E D E R

Column3:

C A R E E R

Column4:

A L E P P O

Column5:

P E S T E R

Column6:

E R A S E S

So that solves the crossword.
